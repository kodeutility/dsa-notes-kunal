# 1920. Build Array from Permutation
- Given a zero-based permutation nums (0-indexed), build an array ans of the same length where ans[i] = nums[nums[i]] for each 0 <= i < nums.length and return it.
- A zero-based permutation nums is an array of distinct integers from 0 to nums.length - 1 (inclusive).
```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,2,1,5,3,4]
Output: [0,1,2,4,5,3]
Explanation: The array ans is built as follows: 
ans = [nums[nums[0]], nums[nums[1]], nums[nums[2]], nums[nums[3]], nums[nums[4]], nums[nums[5]]]
    = [nums[0], nums[2], nums[1], nums[5], nums[3], nums[4]]
    = [0,1,2,4,5,3]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,0,1,2,3,4]
Output: [4,5,0,1,2,3]
Explanation: The array ans is built as follows:
ans = [nums[nums[0]], nums[nums[1]], nums[nums[2]], nums[nums[3]], nums[nums[4]], nums[nums[5]]]
    = [nums[5], nums[0], nums[1], nums[2], nums[3], nums[4]]
    = [4,5,0,1,2,3]
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
0 <= nums[i] < nums.length
The elements in nums are distinct.
 

Follow-up: Can you solve it without using an extra space (i.e., O(1) memory)?
```

# Solution 1
- Time Complexity : O(N)
- Space Complexity : O(N)
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] buildArray(int[] nums) {
        int[] ans = new int[nums.length];
        
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
            ans[i] = nums[nums[i]];
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
}
```
# Solution 2
- Time Complexity : O(N)
- Space Complexity : O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] buildArray(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            /* this is done to keep both old and new value together. 
            going by the example of [5,0,1,2,3,4]
            after this nums[0] will be 5 + 6*(4%6) = 5 + 24 = 29;
            now for next index calulation we might need the original value of num[0] 
            which can be obtain by num[0]%6 = 29%6 = 5;
            if we want to get just he new value of num[0], 
            we can get it by num[0]/6 = 29/6 = 4 */
            
            nums[i] = nums[i] + n*(nums[nums[i]] % n);
        }
        
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            nums[i] = nums[i]/n;
        }
        
        return nums;
    }
}
```
# Notes
- The intuition behind doing the problem in constant space is that we must process the original array
    - in-place
    - in a way that allows us to move the correct value (nums[nums[i]) to it's correct place (i)
    - while also keeping the original value, (nums[i]), in-place, in some way so that we can use it when needed later.
- We must keep nums[i] intact because if, for example, a later position in the array, say j, has a value nums[j] = i, but we've overwrote the value at i (nums[i]) with nums[nums[i]] already, then we're out of luck.
- To accomplish this task, we're going to use the fact that if we have a number of the form `a = qb + r`, where `b` and `r` are not multiples of `q` and `r < q`, then we can extract `b` and `r` with the following:
    - `b = a // q` (where // is integer division) - we know that qb when divided by `q` will give us `b`, however we still would need to get rid of the `r // q`. From our requirements though, `r < q`, so `r // q` will always be `0`, thus `b = (qb//q) + (r//q) = b + 0 = b`
    - `r = a % q` - we know that `qb` is a multiple of `q`, thus is divided by it cleanly and we know that `r < q`, so `r` is not a multiple of `q`, therefore the remainder when dividing `a = qb + r` by `q` is just `r`
- We need to find a way to transform every element of nums into the form `a = qb + r`.
- At every `i`, `nums[nums[i]]` is going to be our `b` and the original value, `nums[i]` is our `r`. Now we just need a `q` that satisfies the `r < q`, for all the possible `r` values (all nums[i]). Luckily, we have such a `q` already, as our array values are indices into the same array. `q = len(nums)` is always guaranteed to be greater than all nums[i] because each index is always within the bounds of the array, from 0 to len(nums) - 1.
- The `a = qb + r` idea is taken directly from `Euclidean Division`. It works here because we have the nice constraint that all elements are valid indices, so it's easy to find `q`, but I'm not sure if there's a general technique of applying this to list processing problems.
